# Relational-Database-Project
We worked on a semester long project on designing and implementing a relational database for a fictitious movie theater in Atlanta.
The completed project includes the following database elements.

        1. Entity Relational Diagram
            -Manifests the relationships (parents-children, cardinalities) between different entities
         
        2. Information Flow Diagram
            -Shows how different information are communicated and stored
           
        3. Physical Database and Schema Design
        
        4. Stored Procedures
            -Written in SQL, which stores information into the database according to users' input
            
        5. GUI Application for the Database
            -A User Interface Application written in JavaFx, which allows the user to communicate with the database
